I've been building software since 2001 when it was just a hobby. 
I graduated from The University of Kansas in 2013 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a Bio-Mechanical concentration.
After graduation I went to work in the Automotive Manufacturing Industry where I took up programming full time.
Now I am now a Full-Stack Engineer building enterprise software for the [Research Institute](https://github.com/Research-Institute/) 
at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City.
